            When you use an application on your mobile phone, the application
            connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then
            retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions
            and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets
            that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a
            readable way.

            REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style
            for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making
            it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant
            systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they
            are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We
            will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial
            characteristics for services on the Web.

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to
            structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
            structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
            using images and data tables
